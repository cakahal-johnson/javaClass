    //Make more research on uses of Java Programming.
    //Mention three Java Editors
    //Give me a breakdown of importance of Java
    //Challenges Java programmers Face.
    
    //Answers 1. Uses:
    
    //1.   GUI applications
    //2.   Web servers and applications Servers
    //3.   Middleware applications
    //4.   Web applications
    //5.   Mobile applications
    //6.   Embedded systems
    //7.   Enterprise apllications
    
    //Answer 2. 3 Java Editors:
    
    //IDEs 1. Eclipse 2. NetBeans 3. IntelliJ IDEA
    //text 1. jEdit 2. Sublime Text 3. TextPad
    
    //Answer 3. Importance of Java:
    // Simple and easy to learn. Java shares syntax with C and C++.
    //Explicit pointers, operator overloading, storage classes,
    //and other elements that are present in C++ are not available in Java.
    //This makes it a less complex language for writing code.
    
    //Object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is treated
    //as an object and has accompanying features like class, encapsulation,
    //abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
    
    //Multithreading is supported by Java. Large applications can be converted
    //to multiple threads and executed simultaneously.
    //This reduces the resources and time needed to execute a program.
//Platform agnostic language. Since Java runs within its virtual
    //machine sandbox, the platform and its computer architecture need not be
    //considered while writing Java applications. 
    //The same code can be executed by different platforms without recompiling
    //for each device, making project management easy.
//Secure platform. Java programs are executed within its runtime environments.
    //It also provides a classloader to load classes to the runtime environment.
    //This provides a buffer and is inherently secure. That said, Java browser
//plugins are extremely insecure and are better deactivated as most of the
  //web now runs on JavaScript.
