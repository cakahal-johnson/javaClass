         DEFINITION OF JAVA
        Java is the first programming language it's also a platform, it is a high level
        it is also secured and object oriented programming language
        
        it is a platform b'cos it has it's own runtime enviroment (JRE) as extention
        
        NB: Any hardware or software enviroment in which a programm runs is reffered as a Platform
        
        VARIABLE DEFINITION:
        Is a memory control like a container for storing data values
        
        Syntax:
        a variable starts with DataType followed by var then next is assignment operand with = sign
        thereafter we have the Values
        NB: this vlaues for String will be wrapped in qoute tag while Numbers are without qoutes
        
        TYPES OF VARIABLES:
        PRIMITIVE DATATYPE AND NON-PERMITIVE DATATYPE
        
        
        PRIMITIVE: are predefined types of data, which are supported by the programming Lang.
        Exmples: int which is for Integer, String are for words, Char which for characters
        
        List of java Primitives:
        String: for storing text, such as "Holy Molly", String values are surrounded by double quotes, max index 225
        int: for storing injtegers(whole number), without decimals, eg:1234567890 or -1234..., max index 11
        float: this stores floating point numbers, with decimals e.g: 10.99 or -10.99, max index 4
        double: is same as float but has a max 8 characters
        char: stores single character such as 'a' or 'b surrounded by single quotes only
        boolean: stores values with two State which is ture or false
        
        
        Non-Primitive:
        these are not from programmers, but instead is created by us as programmer
        where it is referes as "Reference variables"
        
        it also be called "Object reference" since they reference a memory location, which stroes data
        
        Rules of Variables:
        --All var Mut start with a primitive dataType
        --Names can contain letters, digits, underscores and a dollar sign
        --Names must begin with a letter or sign but not with number
        --Names very very case-sensitive
        --No white-space very very important
