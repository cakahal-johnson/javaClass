            Java Method: 
                A method: this is a block code of line which only runs when it is called
        you can pass a data, known as parameters, into method
        
        hence these methods are to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions
        
        REASONS we use Methods?
        ---just to reuse code: define the code once, it can be used in many time;
        
        Rules of Methods:
        a method must be declared within a class, it is defined with the name of the method followed by parentheses().
        here java prodivdes some pre-defined methods, such as System.out.print(),
        where you can also create your own methods to perform certain actions
        
        Example n syntax:
        Public class main(){
            static void myMethod(){
                ...code to be executed here
            }
        }
        
        so what do we mean here:
        myMethod() = is the name of the method
        
        static = means that the method belongs to the main class not an Object of the Main Class.
            You will learn more ablout objects and how to access methods.
        
        void = means that this method does not have a return value

     /*
       JAVA METHOD PARAMETERS
        here information can be passed to methods parameter
        this Paremeters act as variables inside the method
        
        Paremeters are specified after the methods name, inside the parentheses.
        you can add as many parameters as you want, just separate them with a comma.
        
        Examples:
            here we have a method that takes a String called fname as parameter
        when the method is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the method to print the full name:
        
        NB: when a parameter is passed to the method, it is called an argument.
            so, from the
