    we said variables is like a container for storing data values
    
    we have Two Type: Primitive and non-primitive data types
    
    Primitive Data Types: are perdefined types of data, which are supported or created by the programming lang.
    
    Examples:
    Ingeters which int for numbers
    Strings which holds words:
    char for characters
    float for decimals
    
    boolean for condition which is true or false
    
    Non-Primitive data types:
    there are not defined by the programming lang. but instead created by the programmer(which is me)
    they are sometimes called "Reference Variables or Object reference since they reference a memory location stored
    
    Variable syntax:
    type of variable = value;
    where: equal sign is called assigning
