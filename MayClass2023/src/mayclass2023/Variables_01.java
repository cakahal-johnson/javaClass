                Definition of JAVA:
                java is the first of all programming language and also a platform. 
                it is a high level language, secured and Object Oriented Programming language
                
                i.e it is a platform b'cos it has it's own runtime environment (JRE)
                
                Platform: is defined as any hardware or software enviroment in which a program
                runs is refferes as a platform
                
                Definition Variable:
                is a memory control like a container for storing data values
                
                Types of Variable:
                Primitive Datatype and Non-primitive
                
                PRIMITIVE: there are predefined type of data, which are supported by the programming Language
                Example: integer(int) means numbers, String (""or ''), Characters
                
                LIST of the java Primitive:
                String: is for storing text, such as "cakahal johnson", String values are surrounded by
                         double or single Quotes
                int: This is for storing integers(whole numbers), without decimal such as:
                example: 1234567890 or -123456789 without quotes with 11 bits
                
                float: this stores floating points numbers, with decimal such as 99.9 or -99.0
                
                char: stores single character such as 'a' or 'b'. char values are surrounded by single quotes only
                
                Boolean: stores values with two states: true or false
                
                NON-PRIMITIVE:
                these are not define by the programming language, but are instead created by the programmers
                Example: There are referes as "Reference Variables_01"
                
                NB: or 'Object reference" since they reference a memory location, which stores data.
                
                Syntax:
                dataType(primitives) Reference (variable Name) = (equal sign means assigning) "if string" or 123(number)

                comment is for code documentations:
