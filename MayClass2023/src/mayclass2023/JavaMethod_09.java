           Java Method:
        This is a primitive method: which is a block of code which only runs when it is called
        you can pass a data, inside the parenthese() known as parameters into a method.
        
        hence these methods are to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions
        
        REASONS we use Methods?
        --We use Methods just to be able to be reusing code, where we define the code once
           and call it out as many as we want to perform the same action  
        
        RULE of Methods:
        
        A method must be declared within a class, it is defined with the name of
        the method followed by parenthese()
        
        Here Java prodivdes some pre-defined methods, such as System.out.println()...
        
        Whereby, we can also create our own methods to perform certain actions
        
        Example and Syntax:
        Public class main(){
           static void myMethod(){
                ...code to be executed here
            }
        }
        
        so what we mean here:
        
        static: means that the method belongs to the main class not an Object of the Main Class
        
        Void: means that this method does not have a return value
        
        JAVA METHOD PEREMETERS
        is where the information can be passed to methods parameter
        This paremeters act as variables as you want, just separate them with a comma
        
        Examples:
                here we have a method that takes a String called fname as parameter
        when the method is called, we pass along a firstname, which is used inside the method to print
        the full name:
        
        NB: when a parameter is passed to the method, it is called an argument.
