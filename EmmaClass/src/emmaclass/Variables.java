        VARIABLES
        is a memory control like a container for storing data values
        
        JAVA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
        uses JRE is called the Runtime enviroment b'cos Java is Object Orriented Programming lanugage
        
        TWO TYPES OF VARIABLES
        Primitive and Non-primitive
        
        PRIMITIVE: is a predefined type of dat supported by the programming language
        Examples: integer(int) means Number values, String (""), Characters, booleans, float, double
        
        
        Non-primitive: is not define by the programming lanuage, but instend by the programmers
        Example: There are referes as "References Variables"
        
        RULES: same as other variables
        -- All names must start with a DataType i.e String, int, boolean, char, float, double
        -- All names are very case sensitive i.e a name called john is not same John or JOHN
        -- name of the variables can't starts with number but can start with _ or $
        -- NO white-space in writing the variable names
        
        JAVA LETTER-CASES
        -- carmel case means starting with lowercase word and next with upper-case word eg: fullName
        -- pascal case means starting with uppercase word and next with upper-case word eg: FullName
        -- snake case means using underscore inbetween the words e.g: Full_Name
        -- Lower-case
        -- Upper-case
        
        JAVA COMMENT SECTION
        Comments is used for the code documentation which is wrapped in / slash * star .... content .... * star / slash
        which is for multi-line commenting the takes / slash / slash for single line comment
